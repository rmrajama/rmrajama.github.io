Robin Rajam√§ki (Member, IEEE) received his D.Sc. degree in electrical engineering in 2021 from Aalto University, Finland. From 2022-2024, he was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California San Diego, USA. He is currently an assistant professor at Tampere University, Finland. His research interests lie in the intersection of theory and applications of statistical signal processing, optimization, and machine learning, with a focus on multisensor systems in sensing and wireless communications.

#A data-driven personal website
#======
#Like many other J

#Site-wide configuration
#------
#The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables #with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can #remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

#**Markdown generator**
#
#The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
#) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My #usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
